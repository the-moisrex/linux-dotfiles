echo "- Minimize dependencies - prefer standard library over third-party libraries"
echo "- Use constexpr for compile-time computation when possible"
echo "- Apply [[nodiscard]] to functions whose return values should not be ignored"
echo "- Prefer RAII and smart pointers for resource management"
echo "- Use noexcept for functions that don't throw exceptions"
echo "- Leverage templates and concepts for generic programming"
echo "- Implement type safety using strong types and enums"
echo "- Apply the 'use auto, pass by const&, return by value' idiom where appropriate"
echo "- Follow the 'rule of zero' when possible, 'rule of five' when necessary"
echo "- Utilize C++20, C++23, and C++26 features like ranges, coroutines, modules, designated initializers, and std::expected"
echo "- Write efficient, readable, and maintainable code"
